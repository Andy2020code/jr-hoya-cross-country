                <h1>Bryon Blankenbecler</h1>
                <p>Bryon Blankenbecler (aka Coach B) started teaching middle school science in 1992 at Lost Mountain Middle School and he currently teaches at McClure Middle School. From 1996 to 2005 Coach B was the head cross country and track coach at South Cobb High School. After a rough start, the cross country team became competitive and won the region championship in 2005. In 2009 Coach B started the West Cobb Stampede middle school cross country team. The team grew from 10 runners to 50 runners and soon started seeing success in meets. In 2012 the team won the boys and girls divisions at a large, competitive race and in 2013 the boys placed 3rd in the state meet after going undefeated the entire season. In 2017 Coach B led the cross country team at North Cobb Christian and the girls placed second in the metro 10 championships. Coach B was asked to help with the Jr. Hoyas in 2018 and soon became the head coach. This was a homecoming, because two of his own children ran for the Harrison High School team. The team is very successful under Coach B's knowledge, including boys being ranked #1 in the state in 2021.  

                    Coach B is married to Donna, who teaches Math at Harrison, and has three grown children that still run and bike almost every day. Coaching allows him to be a positive force in the community and teach children about grit, discipline, and the joy of running. Coach B is honored to work with the kids and families of the Harrison community!
